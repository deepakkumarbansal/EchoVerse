# Echoverse 🌌

We often have thoughts, hopes, memories, or confessions we want to record — not for others, but for our future selves. EchoVerse is a safe space where users can record short audio diaries and set them to be unlocked on a future date. Until then, they stay encrypted and invisible.

This app isn't just storage — it's intentional reflection, time-travel journaling, and memory-keeping made real.
